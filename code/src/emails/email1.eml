Dear Support Team,

I am writing to inquire about the status of a payment I made on 15-Mar-2025. The payment was for USD 2,500.00, and it was supposed to be credited to my account #123456. I have not received any confirmation yet, and I would appreciate an update on this matter.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thanks & Regards,
John Doe
